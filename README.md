2023 It Security Home Project

The task was to create a small forum application with apropriate data protection.
I used md5 to hash the passwords, https to send the data and a firewall on the database.
I created the frontend using HTML with CSS and Javascript, the backend using Python with the Flask framework, and MySql for the database, which i accessed via SqlAlchemy.

The actual website is no longer online, due to security reasons.
